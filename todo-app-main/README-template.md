### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<body>Some HTML code I'm proud of
  <ul class="todos bg-white dark:bg-input-bg divide-y divide-gray-500 text-listColor dark:text-textColor mt-4 rounded shadow-md select-none"></ul>
</body>
```
```js
function proudOfThisJavascript{
  let index = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('CompletedTodos') || '[]');
    for(let i = 0; i < index.length; i++){
      [...listContainer.children][index[i]].children[0].firstElementChild.setAttribute('checked','checked');
      [...listContainer.children][index[i]].children[0].firstElementChild.classList.add('dark:bg-current','border-current');
      [...listContainer.children][index[i]].children[0].firstElementChild.classList.remove('dark:bg-transparent', 'border-gray-300');
      [...listContainer.children][index[i]].classList.add('line-through', 'text-gray-400', 'complete');
      [...listContainer.children][index[i]].classList.remove("active");
    }

    function clearCompletedTodos(){
    let completedTodos = document.querySelectorAll('.complete');
    if(completedTodos.length > 0 && confirm(`You are about to delete ${completedTodos.length} task(s).`)){
      for (let x of completedTodos) {
        x.remove();
        todoCount();
      }
    }else if(completedTodos.length <= 0){
      alert(`There are ${completedTodos.length} completed todos`)
    }
    updateLocalStorage()
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue to develop on my proficiency with tailwindcss, go further into learning react, jquery and other libraries and frameworks.

### Useful resources

- [Sortable JS](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sortablejs@latest/Sortable.min.js) - This helped me give the users the ability of reordering their todos. I really liked this resource and will use it going forward when necessary.
- [TailwindCss](https://www.tailwindcss.com) - This is an amazing library which helped me with the styling. It's just amazing. I'd recommend it to anyone.
